NAME
    MetaPOD - An evolution of POD

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

What is MetaPOD
  1. Documentation About Documentation
    MetaPOD is a system intended to express the relationships between
    different documents, and express the importance and context of other
    things within the documents, and express how the documents as a whole
    fit together

  2. Documentation about Meta
    MetaPOD also is a system by which one can express relationships about
    code, code which has documentation, but how the documentation is related
    to other documentation requires you to normally understand the
    meta-level information within the code works, so, this system aims to
    make the "metalevel" more visible from the surface, so the meta-level
    information can be more easily used to

    *   Aggregate multiple documents to a single document in line with how
        the Meta layer works

    *   Show pretty graphs and things showing how classes are related to
        each other

People who are writing MetaPOD
    Eventually, the goal is to have the MetaPOD itself generateable via
    tools during development, so that the meta-layer information is cemented
    into the POD itself, before, or during release.

    In that vein, I hope to make a "Dist::Zilla" plugin that does this for
    you.

    In the mean time, the documents you want to be reading are

    *   "MetaPOD::Spec" - The general specification for all forms of MetaPOD

    *   "MetaPOD::JSON" - Information specific to the JSON based
        implementation of MetaPOD

People who are wanting to read MetaPOD
    *   "MetaPOD::Assembler" - The tool that translates documents containing
        "MetaPOD" into "MetaPOD::Result" Objects
